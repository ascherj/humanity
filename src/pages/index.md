subheading: A collection of life’s vignettes on this human's journey
intro: >-
  This book is a collection of my “humanity moments”. What exactly does that mean? It’s the moments I witness in my day to day life that make my insides smile and appreciate humanity. It could be as simple as watching a mom dance with her daughter in the park, or as complex as my excited uber driver telling me how he is going to meet his birth mom soon for the first time on his 40th birthday. It’s moments where I felt compelled to whip out my phone and make a note. Oftentimes, I can’t always describe how that moment made me feel besides sighing, “Ahhh humanity”. Usually I am overcome by a visceral feeling in my soul. My humanity moments might not be your humanity moments, but I hope when you read this book it makes you stop and think and ultimately, I hope it makes you happy. I hope it makes you pause and forget about thoughts preventing you from truly being present. Maybe after this you’ll be more sensitive to your own “humanity” moments and realize that at the end of the day, we are all the same.
