Looking for an all-natural homemade dreamy face cream? One that your face will start rejoicing in song once applied? Look no further.

More than half of what we put on our skin gets absorbed into our bodies. This means that it eventually ends up in our bloodstream! This means that we should care what we put on it!!

Especially our face aka the money maker ;)  

Far too often there are ingredients that people cannot even pronounce in face creams and moistures that are available in drug stores:

* Parabens
* Alcohols
* Formaldehyde 
* Fragrances 
* Phthalates
* Polyethylene Glycol (PEGs)

Gross. 

This recipe is only 3 ingredients! Here’s why I love it:

* It works!
* It’s all-natural. 
* It’s so simple to make.
* It’s eco-friendly (use a reusable glass jar).
* It helps you save money in the long run.

So go ahead and give it a whirl! Your body will thank you :)
