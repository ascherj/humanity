So you’re wondering how to teach English in Spain? You’re in the right place. 



Some of you may be ready to book your plane ticket tomorrow, while some of you are still toying around with this idea in your mind. No worries! Come one come all. 



I have been teaching English in Spain for almost two years now through the Auxiliares de Conversación program. In this post I will share with you my journey and what resources I used to turn my crazy idea into my current reality. 



If you are just looking for the resources and logistic part of this article, scroll halfway down and you will find a helpful list :)



If you want a little extra hype and encouragement keep reading! 



If you’re wishing and dreaming of experiencing life in Spain but fear is holding you back...I understand. If you think you do not have the guts to take this leap, let me stop you right there. 



I was what you call a homebody just a few years ago. I grew up, went to college and worked in the DC area my whole life. I would go home every Sunday in college and for the next two years after graduation. 



Once I broke the news to my 3 roommates that I would not be renewing our lease, they said that I was the last person they thought who would be a flight risk. 



The back story is that I went on a work trip to Barcelona. While I was there something clicked and I realized that I have been in a DC bubble my whole life. 



I wanted to expand my mind, meet new people, experience new culture, learn a new language, the whole shabang. 



At that time, I had no clue how or when I would make my move but I knew I had to and I was going to. One online course later and tons and tons of research later, I was ready to make my move! One year from that work trip, I quit my sales job and now live in sunny Valencia, wooohoooo!



Best. Decision. Ever. 



This is how I made everything possible as an AMERICAN Citizen. I am not 100% familiar with the legal process if you are from other countries but a lot of this information will still be relevant for you.



Here are the steps I followed along the way:



1. Make sure you have a passport. One that will not expire while you are in Spain (or whatever country you may choose). I know this is common sense but hey ya never know!



2. TEFL certification. TEFL stands for teaching English as a foreign language. So depending on which country you want to teach in and through which program, there may be different TEFL requirements. I went through [this TEFL certification program](https://www.internationalteflacademy.com/lp-referral-program?grsf=cnj975): the International TEFL Academy.



My course was a 12 week online course that I did while also working full time.



I will admit, this TEFL program is a little on the expensive side but after a lot of research I ultimately decided with this company because:

* Student Affairs Advisor - You get assigned an advisor FOR LIFE to help you with the job search process
* Country specific facebook group - There is a specific facebook group for a ton of countries with alumni that are teaching or have taught there. There you can find job opportunities, tips and instant friends, especially if you are moving to that country alone. 
* The endless online resources - There are ample resources at your fingertips. Job search guidance manuals, country specific guides, etc.
* They’re actually legit and are recognized and accepted worldwide. This certification allows you to teach in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.



Apparently they are offering flexible payment plans due to Covid 19. They may offer some discounts as well, I would just ask! That’s what I did :)



I am sure there are also plenty of other reputable TEFL certification companies that people love but I can not speak to any of them since I have only taken ITA’s course. 



[The Auxiliares de Conversación program or also called The North American Language and Culture Assistants Program](https://www.educacionyfp.gob.es/eeuu/convocatorias-programas/convocatorias-eeuu/nalcap.html) is the government program that I am currently teaching through. This program only requires a college degree or for you to be in your junior or senior year of  BA or BS program. They do not require a TEFL certification. 



I still am TEFL certified because I was not 100% sure which country I wanted to end up in or what their requirements might have been. 



The program I teach with is only about 16 hours a week so I have ample time for a second job. I have done private tutoring lessons and have worked ‘under the table’ at private after school english academies. 



Having this on your resume will only enhance your opportunities for finding a second job; especially if you do not have a college degree!



If you want to teach in Spain but you do not want to go the public government route (Click HERE to read about my experience with the program) or through a set program, your other option is to find employment with a private employer; many of which will want to see a TEFL certification. 



TEFL certifications are also good for life! Once you take the leap to teach abroad, it opens your mind to different possibilities and opportunities in the future. Who knows, you may start in Spain and find yourself in South Korea next. 



For this move, you will need a TEFL certification..so in my opinion it is always nice to have. 



3. Decide on which program! I went through the The Auxiliares de Conversación program or also called The North American Language and Culture Assistants Program. You can click HERE to read about my experience. 



Here are some other programs that I am aware of in Spain:

* [Meddeas](https://www.meddeas.com/) - Various locations
* [Coversa Spain](https://www.conversaspain.com/) - Opportunities in Madrid and Murcia.
* BEDA Program - Majority in Madrid but placements available everywhere
* [UCETAM](https://colegiosbilinguescooperativos.com/auxiliares-conversacion/english-language-assistant/) - Madrid
* [UP International Education](http://www.upinternationaleducation.com/)
* [Fulbright Spain](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/spain)
* Private academies



The other options are private academies. It is nearly impossible to obtain a working visa since the unemployment rate is so high so the majority of people that go this route teach “under the table”. Meaning they do not have a visa and they get paid in cash. 



If you want to teach at private academies legally, many people also enroll in classes at a university to receive a student visa. 



I do not have much information about the other programs listed above but I do know that some of them have fees associated.
