So you’re wondering how to teach English in Spain? You’re in the right place. 

Some of you may be ready to book your plane ticket tomorrow, while some of you are still toying around with this idea in your mind. No worries! Come one come all. 

I have been teaching English in Spain for almost two years now through the Auxiliares de Conversación program. In this post, I will share my journey and what resources I used to turn my crazy idea into my current reality. 

**If you are just looking for the resources and logistics part of this article, scroll down a tad and you will find a helpful list :)**

If you want a little extra hype and encouragement, keep reading! 

If you’re wishing and dreaming of experiencing life in Spain but fear is holding you back...I understand. If you think you do not have the guts to take this leap, let me stop you right there. 

I was what you call a ‘homebody’ just a few years ago. I grew up, went to college, and worked in the DC area my whole life. I went home every Sunday in college and for the next two years after graduation. 

Once I broke the news to my three roommates that I would not be renewing our lease, they said that I was the last person they thought would be a flight risk haha.

The back story is that I went on a work trip to Barcelona. While I was there, something clicked and I realized that I have been in a DC bubble my whole life. 

I wanted to expand my mind, meet new people, experience a new culture, learn a new language, the whole shebang. 

At that time, I had no clue how or when I would make my move but I knew I had to and I was going to. One online course later and tons and tons of research later, I was ready to make my move! One year from that work trip, I quit my sales job and now live in sunny Valencia... wooohoooo!

Best. Decision. Ever. 

This is how I made everything possible as an **AMERICAN** Citizen. I am not 100% familiar with the legal process if you are from another country but a lot of this information will still be relevant for you.

## Here are the steps I followed along the way:

**1. Make sure you have a passport**. One that will not expire while you are in Spain (or whatever country you may choose). I know this is common sense but hey ya never know!

**2.TEFL certification**. TEFL stands for teaching English as a foreign language. Depending on which country you want to teach in or which program you want to teach through, there may be different TEFL requirements. I went through [International TEFL Academy (ITA).](https://www.internationalteflacademy.com/lp-referral-program?grsf=cnj975)

My course was an 11-week online course that I did while also working full time.

I will admit, this TEFL program is a little on the expensive side but after a lot of research I ultimately decided with this company because:

* **Student Affairs Advisor** - You get assigned an advisor FOR LIFE to help you with the job search process.
* **Country-specific Facebook groups** - There is a specific Facebook group for a ton of countries with alumni that are teaching or have taught there. There, you can find job opportunities, tips, and instant friends, especially if you are moving to that country alone! 
* **The endless online resources** - There are ample resources at your fingertips. Job search guidance manuals, country-specific guides, etc.
* **They’re actually legit** and are recognized and accepted worldwide. This certification allows you to teach in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Apparently, they are offering flexible payment plans now due to Covid. They may offer some discounts as well...I would just ask! That’s what I did :)

I am sure there are also plenty of other reputable TEFL certification companies that people love but I cannot speak to any of them since I have only taken ITA’s course. 

The Auxiliares de Conversación program or also called The North American Language and Culture Assistants Program is the government program that I am currently teaching through. This program only requires a college degree or for you to be in your junior or senior year of a BA or BS program. They do not require a TEFL certification. 

I still am TEFL certified because I was not 100% sure which country I wanted to end up in or what their requirements might have been. 

The program I teach with is only about 16 hours a week so I have ample time for a second job. I have done private tutoring lessons and have worked ‘under the table’ at private after-school English academies. 

Having a TEFL on your resume will only enhance your opportunities for finding a second job; especially if you do not have a college degree!

If you want to teach in Spain but you do not want to go the public government route or through a set program, your other option is to find employment with a private employer; many of which will want to see a TEFL certification. 

TEFL certifications are also valid for life! Once you take the leap to teach abroad, it opens your mind to different possibilities and opportunities in the future. Who knows, you may start in Spain and find yourself in South Korea next. 

For this move, you will need a TEFL certification..so in my opinion, it is always nice to have.

**3. Decide on which program!** I went through [The Auxiliares de Conversación program or also called The North American Language and Culture Assistants Program](https://www.educacionyfp.gob.es/eeuu/convocatorias-programas/convocatorias-eeuu/nalcap.html). 

Here are some other programs that I am aware of in Spain:

* [Meddeas](https://www.meddeas.com/) - Various locations
* [CoversaSpain](https://www.conversaspain.com/) - Opportunities in Madrid and Murcia.
* [CIEE](https://www.ciee.org/go-abroad/work/teach-english-abroad) - Solely Madrid
* [UCETAM](https://colegiosbilinguescooperativos.com/auxiliares-conversacion/english-language-assistant/) - Solely Madrid
* [UP International Education](http://www.upinternationaleducation.com/)
* [Fulbright Spain](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/selectedcountry/spain)
* Private academies

The other options are private academies. It is nearly impossible to obtain a working visa since the unemployment rate is so high, so the majority of people that go this route teach “under the table”. This means they do not receive a visa and they get paid in cash. 

People who choose this option typically move to Spain without a job lined up and go knocking door to door, pitching themselves to different private academies in their area. 

If you want to teach at private academies legally, many people also enroll in classes at a university to receive a student visa. 

I do not have much information about the other programs listed above but I do know that some of them may have fees associated.

**4. Make a budget.** This will vary based on your circumstances. Some people will come straight from college while others have a few year’s savings under their belt. 

I will warn you, if you choose the program that I am in, they will pay late!!!!! Some regions will pay on time but I am currently in Valencia and I would STRONGLY encourage you to move with at least a couple of month’s savings.

**5. Schedule appointments at your embassy!** Depending on which city you live in, your embassy may require an initial scheduled appointment or it may be walk-ins only. I went to the Washington DC consulate and it was walk-ins only.

If it is walk-ins only, I would advise not going on the first of the month. I have always noticed a longer line those days. With Covid, everything may require an appointment now. I would double-check on your embassy’s website.

You are able to apply for your visa up to 90 days before the start of your program. You need to bring a notarized criminal background check, medical certificate, national visa application form, one passport-sized photo, your passport, proof of employment at your school, and proof of income. This is specifically for the long term student visa.

There are also fees associated. Please check your embassy’s website for the correct forms and fee amounts.  

**6. Housing research!** I did housing research before making my move to Spain and the general consensus is to NEVER book an apartment without seeing it in person first.

People usually stay in an Air Bnb or hostel for a week while they apartment hunt. Many people line up showings a week or two before they even move out there. 

I did not listen to this advice and I anxiously booked something through [Spotahome](https://www.spotahome.com/referral-welcome/SHAY-4d2m2-T?utm_campaign=referral_tenant&utm_medium=copy) and it turned out well but I would not recommend it! I had some friends that were not as lucky. 

You will naturally start making connections by joining Facebook or WhatsApp groups. People always post housing opportunities in these groups. 

With that said, I would recommend researching the different neighborhoods within your city that you may be interested in. This way you can narrow down your search radius. You’ll be able to line up more specific apartment viewings based on your preferences. 

Here are some helpful housing sites:

* [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com/en/)
* [Badi](https://badi.com/us/)
* [Spotahome](https://www.spotahome.com/referral-welcome/SHAY-4d2m2-T?utm_campaign=referral_tenant&utm_medium=copy)
* [Pisos.com](https://www.pisos.com/)

Some people have had some luck with long term [Air Bnb.](https://www.airbnb.com/c/shaynaa346)

**7. Join Facebook groups!** This is a great way to make connections before you even land. You may be able to find potential employment opportunities if you decide to go the “under the table” route. 

You can also ask any specific question you may have or search the group for general information. I still use it as a constant resource 1.5 years in. There are a ton of region-specific pages!

I live in the center of Valencia and here are some examples of pages that I am apart of:

* [Girls in Valencia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/girlsinvalencia)
* [Auxiliares de Conversación en Valencia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/auxiliaresVLC)
* [Expats in Valencia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/expatsinvalenciacommunity) 

**8. Start learning Spanish!** I’m not talking about anything too advanced...although the more the merrier. I moved to Spain only knowing the basics. “Hello, how are you”, “Where’s the bathroom”, “left”, “right”, you get the point. 

But I will say, even my bare minimum Spanish knowledge was helpful in the beginning.

Even downloading Duolingo will give you a nice little head start. I am now conversational in Spanish and I made a list of tips that were/are crucial to my learning, [HERE](https://thehumanitybooks.com/blog/2021-02-16-10-tips-to-learn-spanish/). 

**9. Sign up for online teaching sites.** Almost all of my friends who are English teachers in Spain have plenty of time for a side gig. Besides babysitting, teaching English online is one of the most popular options.

I teach on [Cambly](https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=shayna65) and really enjoy it because of it's flexible schedule. Check out my review [HERE.](https://thehumanitybooks.com/blog/2021-01-10-is-teaching-on-cambly-worth-it/) 

Below are some other popular sites:

* [VIPkid](https://www.vipkid.com/teach)
* [Whales English](https://www.whalesenglish.com/?channel=whalesenglish)
* [Italki](https://teach.italki.com/application?gclid=CjwKCAiAxKv_BRBdEiwAyd40Nw3UKMiersWDwwi0x6Az9ol-cLdY-NP1wkXXVvTokk1QaD607FZU3xoCPDMQAvD_BwE)

* [Lingoda](https://www.lingoda.com/en/become-a-teacher/)
* [Qkids](https://teacher.qkids.com/)
* Palfish - download the app

I actually made an account and got approved while I was still in the US in September but did not teach my actual first lesson until March. 

**10. Book your flight!!!!** Hiring seasons and program start dates are usually around September/October with an alternative hiring season in January. 

Plan your trip around this...especially if you are going to be looking for a job once you arrive in Spain!

Okay well, here it is!!! I know this is a TON of info but don’t be overwhelmed. Everyone started out knowing nothing. I hope it’s been helpful...enjoy your journey! I’m excited for you :)
