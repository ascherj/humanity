Bienvenidos!! So you’re doing research on how to learn Spanish? Maybe this is this first article you landed on in your quest or if you are like me, the 854th article. Regardless, I am happy you are here!



I have been living in Spain for the past 1.5 years and I started learning Spanish from scratch when I moved out here. Disclaimer: I am still learning and have a TON more to learn. No doubt. But, I am now conversational in Spanish and consider my level intermediate.



I want to share the tips I have cultivated on this long, tumultuous but satisfying journey. 



First of all, you need to want this so badly if you are going to stick with this journey and put in the work. You need to constantly remind yourself of your WHY. Why do you want to learn??



For me, it was for the extra amount of people I will be able to communicate with and connect with! Also to survive in Spain (nervous laugh). Not to mention, you will have the ability to dive deeper into any Spanish-speaking culture.



Of course, if it is possible, the best way to learn quickly is to live in a country where Spanish is the primary language. I understand this is not possible for a majority of people, so no worries, you will still find a lot of useful tips below!



If you are interested in moving to Spain, check out my article: How to Teach English in Spain.



Some of these are more covid friendly than others and all of these tips are free besides one!



Let’s dive in.



1. Coffee Break Spanish



This is one of my top two favorite ways to learn Spanish. It’s a podcast that grows with you!!! What I mean by this is that there are ___ seasons that start from very very basic and progressively get more advanced. There is a TON of content. 



It seemed like my level of Spanish progressed perfectly with the podcast and the seasons. The first season is the host Mark with a student who is learning just like you. You learn the essential phrases and vocabulary needed for a beginner. Other seasons include listening to actual recordings from natives that he interviews, listening to stories, and learning local slang.



It’s free and all the episodes are digestible “coffee break” length. 



2. Baselang



This is the other one of my top two favorite ways to learn. THIS ONE GOT ME THROUGH QUARANTINE. I am not lying. This is an online platform where you can take virtual Spanish lessons via zoom with their teachers. They have a ton of teachers to choose from. The lessons are 30 minutes long and you can schedule a lesson 1 minute before that time slot if you really wanted to. On the contrary, you can schedule them one week in advance as well. I had their unlimited plan during quarantine which is $149 a month for an unlimited amount of lessons. I took 3 lessons every day. That’s 21 lessons a week or 84 lessons a month! What a deal.



Once you are on the platform for some time, you find your favorite teachers that match your learning style that you build rapport with. Finding that handful of teachers is super important to your growth. You may click with one immediately or you may test out a few. It may be a process. The good news is, any exposure to a native Spanish speaker is good exposure. It can never hurt! 



I live in Spain where I am used to hearing Spanish every day. Baselang was able to bring that back into my life while being stuck in my apartment during this pandemic.



You get a $1 trial week if you want to give it a whirl! There is also a different payment plan if you want to start with something lower commitment. The hourly plan is $9 a month and that comes with 1 hour of class included. After that, each lesson is $4.50. 



This is also a great way to incorporate Spanish into your everyday life if you do not have the privilege of living in a Spanish-speaking country. 



They also have great customer service :)



3. [Extra en Espanol series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfb9-ZTCA-E&list=PLLVULqsElvki_riI1ld0QhZJx1wom5Ply&index=1&ab_channel=SpanishThailand)



This is the television series that you have been waiting for!!! I know that many series on Netflix for example are too advanced to watch without solely relying on subtitles. This is a series that you can watch for free on YouTube with just the perfect level and speed of Spanish! It’s goofy and corky but perfect for beginners trying to get to that next level. 



I recommend watching it with Spanish subtitles on so you can follow along or look up any unfamiliar words. My only complaint is that it ended abruptly and I wish there were more episodes!!



4. Sticky notes around your room! 



This one is an easy one and great for beginner beginners. Basically, put a little sticky note in Spanish on everything and anything. Your mirror, lamp, lightswitch, draws, windows, shower curtain, you name it and you get the point. 



The constant repetition of viewing these sticky notes daily will drill these words into your brain more than you think! Some nice subconscious learning there for you ;)



5. Language exchanges



I didn’t actually know these existed until I moved to Spain. Basically, a language exchange or intercambio is a place to meet people who speak other languages, specifically the language you are trying to learn. Chances are, they would love to practise their English too! Most of the ones I have attended have been at bars so you can get a nice glass of wine for some liquid courage! There are two main styles: a set time for English and a set time for Spanish, or there are some more relaxed ones that allow you and the table to flow in and out of whatever language you choose at that moment. Basically, you have the freedom to decide with your group what language to speak.



This is such a great way to also meet new people and experience a new culture! Even if you do not live in Spain, there are language exchanges in a ton of cities! I would do a quick google search or look on the site [Meetup.](https://www.meetup.com/lp/goals?utm_medium=SEM&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=mmrk_adwords_orgacq_us_newyears_branded&utm_term=group&utm_content=lp_goals&gclid=CjwKCAiAr6-ABhAfEiwADO4sffgrXncbOCEYPrnxBezN4-BYy1lb7vMud-a2wXbWusB9DwZP4ek17hoC8w8QAvD_BwE)



I started attending these when my Spanish was VERY basic so do not let your level deter you away from attending. Even just sitting and listening will help tremendously.



6. Tinder ;)



This one is a good one if you live in a Spanish-speaking country! Going on dates or friend dates is a perfect way to practice your Spanish and immerse yourself in the culture! Even if you are not looking for something romantic there is a friend setting. Go ahead and push yourself out of your comfort zone..ya never know what might happen!



7. Read signs aloud



This is also a good one if you live in a Spanish-speaking country! Read every sign, no matter how ridiculous, out loud. This will help your reading and pronunciation skills. While you are walking through the streets, just be more aware of all the Spanish around you and start repeating what you see under your breath. 



You can also do this while you pass by people in the streets. Start mimicking the sounds and words they are saying. Do this quietly of course or far enough away from them :)



8. Write song lyrics and translate



During quarantine, I had a lot of time on my hands and one of my teachers from Baselang told me writing down song lyrics in Spanish and translating them into English will help the learning process. 



I realized that I barely wrote in Spanish so it was super helpful to see the spelling of common words. Plus, for me, writing helps my brain solidify what I am learning. It was also helpful to see the translation of different phrases. I even started incorporating those lyrics into my everyday vocabulary. 



After listening to the song on repeat, I was able to start singing along which felt like a massive achievement and I felt more official if ya know what I mean :)

9. Youtube/Netflix/radio



I know this one seems basic and obvious but no joke it is so important!!!!! When you are learning any language, especially if you do not live in a country where they speak your target language, you must try and turn your whole world into that language. 



Listen to Spanish music, turn this free Spanish radio on while you are getting ready in the morning, start watching videos on youtube in Spanish! Search for your favorite subject and add the word ‘Spanish’ at the end and you will have ample content at your disposal. I spent a lot of my quarantine watching vegan cooking videos in Spanish.



Even if you are not actively listening to every word, any exposure helps!!!!!



10. Change your phone



Last but not least, one of my favorite simple tips, change your phone language into Spanish! The most important part is commitment. Heads up, it WILL get super frustrating at points, especially when you want a quick google answer but I promise you it is worth it.



There will be a learning curve but once you get past that, you will notice a difference. I passively learned verbs like send, deliver, erase, unlock, etc. You will be very pleasantly surprised by all the new vocabulary you will learn just by using your apps in Spanish. 



There is not a magic program that will help you learn Spanish in X amount of weeks or even months. Read that again. Trust me, I almost fell prey to a few programs that promised fluency in a few months. 



You have to put in the work...it is as simple as that. And the most important thing is you have to be ready! Nobody can force you to be motivated to learn. You have to become slightly obsessed with the idea of learning. For Pete’s sake, you even have to visualize yourself in the future being able to have full-blown conversations with local native speakers. I found that my journey was a very personal, mental, and even emotional one. 



You CANNOT compare yourself to anyone else’s learning progress. People’s brains work differently, some people have more time than others, more money to invest...everyone’s circumstances are different so you cannot get discouraged!



It is also okay to be shy or have embarrassment when trying to speak around other people who are more advanced than you. Everyone has been there! But you just have to talk the embarrassment away until you no longer feel your cheeks turn red. (To be fair I still sweat when I speak Spanish with locals lol). 



Some people who are also learning may try to show off, just stay tunnel-visioned on your goal and keep chipping away at it. Do not let anyone get in your head. 



There WILL be days where you feel like giving up, where you feel like you are making zero progress. That is normal!!!! But you also WILL have moments where it will all just click. Maybe you will understand a conversation you are overhearing, or you start dreaming a little in Spanish. Whatever your light bulb moment is, they will come and there will be more than one of them if you stick with it.



So just talk talk talk in Spanish, breath, smile, talk some more and enjoy because it will be a very rewarding ride :)
