Newly embarking on a vegan plant-based diet?? Or have you been around the block but are semi-obsessed with watching vegan content on Youtube like I am? 

Whoever you are, wherever you come from, enjoy my list below!

This list is varied, ranging from extremely wholesome to funny to educational to sometimes even a tad inappropriate content. Something for everyone.

I don’t always agree with 100% of their words but nevertheless, they have some entertaining and inspiring content.

I truly believe the world would be a better place with less animal product consumption :)

1. [Pick Up Limes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq2E1mIwUKMWzCA4liA_XGQ):

Sadia Badiei is a registered dietician and a WHOLESOME QWEEN. Seriously though. When I watch her videos I feel like I can breathe deeper. Truly a breath of fresh air. She makes healthy wholesome delicious vegan meals. She is the epitome of a wholesome aesthetic. Her voice, her words, her mindset, her food, her presentation, her cooking, her everything. She is a definite must-watch in the youtube vegan world. You'll walk away calmer than you came. 

2. [Avantgardevegan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF-ACPYNN0oXD4ihS5mbbmw): 

Gaz Oakly is a UK classically trained chef turned YouTuber. His knife skills will leave you memorized and he's not too bad to look at either ;) His dishes look incredible and restaurant quality. His videography is also on point. 

I will warn you that some of his recipes are not the easiest for beginners but they are perfect for a special meal when you have extra time, like right now..cough cough quarantine cough. I seriously want to try everything he makes and his recipes and innovative and creative. He is definitely not making the same classic vegan meals as some other peeps on youtube. 

He also has a [collab video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIHbv9o9rvo&ab_channel=avantgardevegan) with Sadia from Pick Up Limes!

He promised his fans that once he hit 1 million subscribers he would open up a restaurant. He announced his restaurant will be a pop up traveling restaurant so look out for dates in the future :)

3. [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg)

Earthing Ed is IMPORTANT. Probably the most important vegan YouTuber on this list. He is an activist, educator, and public speaker. 

He advocates for animals and the environment with every morsel in his body. Some of his most popular videos are him debating with farmers or non-vegans (add link?). He has comebacks and uses logic that I would never have thought of. He has helped my journey tremendously when I would try to explain why I eat a plant-based diet or would have someone challenge my way of living. (You don't owe anyone anything but still, it's nice to have this information in your arsenal).

He even offers a [free-ebook](https://earthlinged.org/ebook) with 30 non-vegan excuses and how to respond to them. I would also suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58) of his that kind of flip my world upside down at the beginning of my vegan journey. 

I cared before but Ed has definitely made me care more. I am so grateful for his content but I will warn you that some of his content is heavy, emotional, and somewhat triggering. But hey that's what the truth will make ya feel sometimes. 

4. [Tabitha Brown:](https://www.youtube.com/c/TabithaBrown/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid)

Tabitha Tabitha oh where do I start. This woman is legit one of my fav human beings. Her energy is just infectious. I can't even begin to describe it, you just need to watch and see for yourself!! She's hilarious, kind, gentle, fun, and inspiring all in one. She's also real. I watch the first two Youtubers listed above, more for their recipes, and I watch Tabitha more so for her personality. While she still has great and fun vegan recipes, I watch just to be in a better mode really. You can’t help but smile while you watch Tabitha do her thing. 

5. [Merle O´Neal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCle9AaDvd89jq8qWT1QiWkw)

Merle is a vegan vlogger that I originally found on Buzzfeed’s youtube page. She is their go-to host for vegan videos. Check out [Goodfuls youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMArgthHuEtX-04qL_8puQ) (a subset of Buzzfeed) too for more of her awesome videos! 

She recently started her own channel that is more relaxed and open. If you love Merle content from Buzzfeed or Goodful, you’ll love her new channel! On Goodful, her niche is veganizing common meals by using strange ingredients. For example, vegan fried calamari out of coconut, vegan chicken tenders out of grapefruit peels, or making vegan taco meat out of edible flowers.

Her new channel still has recipes and vegan-related content, but also other content that I feel like should be talked about and normalized. For example, she shares her experience going to a sex therapist, etc. We love a normalizing star. She's the type of person I feel like I would be friends with in real life. 

6. [Healthy Crazy Cool ](https://www.youtube.com/c/HealthyCrazyCool/featured)

I feel like this channel is my guilty pleasure in a way. Miles is raw and gets to the point. The majority of his videos are vegan meals he eats in a day but he will go on rants about anything and everything. He is not afraid to state his unpopular opinion on things and drop a few curse words here and there. I like him because he is real...he eats massive portions and I feel like he cooks like a regular person instead of some classically trained chefs that I also watch. 

He has a cute vegan nephew that also joins in some of his videos if you are interested in ideas for vegan kids.

He advocates for lots of fats and oils which isn’t really my style but hey, to each their own. I don't know why but I weirdly can't stop watching when I click on one of his videos. 

7. [Nayna Florence](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClH3eUwzfDTXxUjM8WIJuOg)

I feel like I like Nayna so much because I want to be her friend. She may be on the younger side but she has an old soul. 

She's a college student that vlogs about sustainable living, vegan food, and just her everyday life. We have similar mindsets and interests so it’s cool for me to get a glimpse into her life.

I like to get inspired by her thrifting ideas, gift ideas, morning routines, or simple vegan meals.

This channel is definitely less cooking/meal-based so skip over it if that is your main focus. I would suggest this more for younger, college-aged vegans. I know a lot of people around that age may not understand why you are on a vegan journey so it is nice to be able to relate and see there are lots of people your age like you! Plus she just seems like such a genuine person!

8. [Edgy Veg](https://www.youtube.com/user/stillcurrentstudios)

Edgy veg!!!! She’s always rockin cool hair colors and outfits as well. The reason I love watching her videos is because she tries a lot of other vegan YouTubers’ recipes. She’ll have a video theme, for example, lasagna, and then test out three well-known vegan YouTubers. I like this for three reasons. One, if you are trying to find the perfect recipe, you don’t have to waste time or resources because Candace (edgy veg), has already done it for you! Two, you get exposed to other vegan YouTubers you might not have known existed. And three, it makes me feel warm inside for some reason to see all the YouTubers intermingle. It’s like one little vegan family. On the internet. Who may have never met before. Okay maybe that’s just me?? Anywhooooo, check her out if you like watching other people try new exciting vegan food!

Enjoy!!! Hopefully you will find some vegan motivation during this slow quarantine :)
