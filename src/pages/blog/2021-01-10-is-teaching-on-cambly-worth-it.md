Is [Cambly](https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=shayna65) worth it? In short, my answer is yes. But keep reading because I am going to break down the pros and cons so you can decide if it’s the right platform for you as well!



Don’t know what Cambly is? No worries! If you are interested in teaching online to make a little extra cash, keep reading!  If you are interested in turning teaching English online into your full-time job and you're researching different companies, I’m here to help!

I teach just for some extra cash in my free time. It’s a set rate of $10.20 per hour. You get paid through PayPal.



They just rolled out a new Camby Kids platform that pays a rate of $12 per hour. This platform is geared towards kids from ages 4-15. This platform is more formal than the regular Cambly with a set curriculum. I am not a part of the kid’s program so I am just going to focus on the regular Cambly platform for this post. 



The students have different payment plans. They pay for the number of minutes they want. If you leave your schedule open you can get booked, for example for a 15minute time slot or a 1-hour time slot. It just depends on the student. 



Pros:

* Flexibility. My number 1 reason I love Cambly is for the flexibility. You are in charge of your own hours!!!! You can decide how much or how little you want to teach. You can leave your schedule open all day or teach 1 hour per month. 



* Priority hours. Priority hours work almost like Uber. You select an hour time lot where you’ll be “on”.  Depending on the number of students online, Cambly will then send you various students to chat with. You could chat with one student for the whole hour or maybe 4 students for 15 minutes.

Disclaimer: Depending on which hours you sign up for determines how busy you will be! Sometimes you can talk nonstop for the whole hour and sometimes you have to wait and wait until they send you someone. They guarantee to pay you 15 minutes of the hour even if you do not end up receiving a student within that hour. The rest of the money you make depends on the number of minutes you talk. 



Not receiving a student has been very rare in my experience but it can happen.



This is a great option though if you are bored and have an hour to kill or let’s say your schedule changes and you have a free hour last minute. 



You can sign up for priority hours very last minute too! Once I signed up 5 minutes before my slot. 



The more you teach the more priority slots will open up for you. This is the MOST important and effective way to build a client base. I relied on priority hours for the first month while I built up my rating and met new potential regular students. After that, I would get regular weekly bookings.



* You do not have to prepare anything. Now, this can be a good or bad thing depending on the type of person you are. I usually just have conversation-based classes. This means that I just chat with people about anything and everything. 

For some people that can be their worse nightmare. I enjoy it because I do not have to plan or prepare beforehand. I can simply wake up 5 minutes before a class if I really wanted to and just see where the conversation takes us! 

The platform is super informal which I really like. There are lesson plans/games available for you if you need them but I would say 90% of my lessons do not request a lesson plan, they just want to practice their conversation skills.



* You get to meet people from all over the world! This past year, the top three countries my students were from were: Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. How cool! This is just 3 of many and since I spend the majority of the time just chit-chatting you really get to learn new things about their culture.

* There is no intense interview process. Some other platforms require you to give a mock lesson with a faculty member. Cambly requires you to make an intro video that then gets approved. It is a more laid back process if that was something you are hoping are. 



* You have autonomy over your classes. You can choose what materials you use, you can screen share, sometimes students also come with their own material they want to review. There is a lot of freedom. Like I said earlier, I usually just chat unless my student mentions they want to work on something in particular. 



Cons:

* No structure. There’s no real structure or guidelines. I kind of remember feeling like I was thrown to the wolves my first lesson. It is a learn as you go process. There is a guide you can refer to but it is more of a learn on the job thing.

I now love the no structure aspect of this platform because it’s very relaxed and almost anything goes. I like this because it is a side gig for me...I feel like if I wanted to teach English full time, this may not be the best or most legit platform. I’m sure some people still do it though!



* No curriculum. Again, this is a pro for me but I do know that some people would definitely prefer more guidance. If you are looking for a set PowerPoint or lesson plan for each student this is not the platform! They do have material that your student can request to work on but this doesn’t happen to me quite often.



* Sometimes there are free accounts that troll you. Anyone is able to send you a message. Sometimes you will get free accounts wanting to have a conversation or sometimes they will send inappropriate messages, unfortunately. 

If this happens, I report them and their account gets taken down. You are also able to tell who has a free account v. a paid account. If someone wants to have a pointless conversation with a free account I do not answer them, or I just send them my calendar link without engaging. 



* Feedback system. You’re really only able to see your rating out of 5 stars. You cannot tell what student leaves which rating and you cannot see any actual feedback information. This means that we teachers cannot see what the students like or what we should improve on. 

Cambly did send out an email saying that they are changing this is the new year so maybe by the time you are reading this, it will be different!



* You get a lot of trial students in the beginning. When I was first starting out, whenever I did priority hours, I felt like I was getting sent a lot of 5-minute trial accounts. A lot of these accounts are unqualified so it can be a frustrating beginning. 

If after reading this and you think Cambly sounds like the right platform for you [CLICK HERE](https://www.cambly.com/en/tutors?referralCode=shayna65) to set up an account! Cambly also doesn’t have a minimum requirement so you could always try a few hours and see how it goes!

Happy teaching :)
