After scrolling through my Spotify library, I realized that way too many of my songs were from white men. Black artists need to work that much harder in this industry just based on their skin color.

Here is a list of only some of my favorite Black indie/alternative artists. Only SOME. The list could go on and on and on. 

Streaming these artists' songs is one of the easiest ways to support them. They make money while you listen to incredible music. A win-win situation :)

Even though the streaming service’s payout methods may not be the best (that's a whole other topic), every little bit counts!
