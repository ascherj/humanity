Looking for a DIY, 5-minute homemade natural lip balm? Tired of all the unnecessary chemicals and fragrances in storebought lip balms? You're in the right place!

Parabens, alcohol, petroleum, fragrances, menthol, phenol, salicylic acid, canola oil….would you consciously put any of these ingredients in your body??? I hope your answer is ohhhh hell nahhh. 

Unfortunately, these are common ingredients in store-bought lip balms.

Making your own natural lip balm has many benefits! For example:

1. It’s easier than you think.
2. You know every ingredient that is being absorbed by your body.
3. There are no artificial fragrances that will be a burden on your liver to process.
4. No canola oil! Canola oil has been known to cause inflammation and has been found to feed viruses, bacteria, and even mold. 
5. It's eco friendly if you use a reusable container. Bye-bye plastic yay!!!
6. It will save you money in the long run. 

This recipe is so simple, fast and easy, you will not know why you didn’t start doing this ages ago.

You can choose your favorite essential oil for this recipe! I have used lavender and orange. 

Not to mention, it’s a simple yet fun gift for friends and family! Every time I use it I get “my body is a temple vibes”, ya know?

Enjoy :)
