Looking for a life-changing book? I have been there plentyyyyy o times let me tell you. I have gone through shelves of self-help books that I end up forgetting just months later. 

I have texted my college friend group asking for suggestions and still, I ended up with nothing mind-blowing or life-changing. 

I can’t exactly tell you what I was searching for but I can tell you that nothing I read fulfilled my needs.

This list below has LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE. All caps are necessary because I need you to know how serious I am.

I AM BEING SO SERIOUS. Please read these 3 books. These are my unbiased genuine opinion.

All of them have to do with the body, the mind or the mind-body connection:

1. Medical Medium by Anthony William
2. Becoming Supernatural by Dr. Joe Dispenza
3. The Wim Hof Method by Wim Hof

Let’s break it down:

1. Medical Medium by Anthony William

This is the book that I attribute the start of my plant-based diet. This book focuses more on the body but also on aspects of the mind and spirituality.

Anthony William is a Medium that is able to detect different health problems within people. He started at age four when he diagnosed his Grandma with Lung Cancer. Since then, he has a spirit guide that allows him to know different healing benefits from different foods, supplements and such. 

A lot of his information is ahead of the medical times.

He knows a TONNNN about autoimmune diseases, their origins, and certain foods and supplements that are highly beneficial. He has helped millions recover and even doctors call him to consult on patients. 

I have struggled with chronic UTIs, Styes, and Strep Throat. My mom has had colitis for more than half her life. The information in this book has healed us both from our conditions!! My mom was on all sorts of medicines but after years and years, she is completely off her medication. 

This book requires having an open mind and a little faith. Since Anthony is a medium and not a certified doctor, some people have a harder time believing and accepting his information. Mediums and spirituality are up my alley so I didn't have a hard time giving in but I can understand why some people do. I just want you to know that I have never felt better in my entire life. I also recently got a blood analysis and all my levels are within a normal healthy range. If you are struggling with a chronic illness, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain from reading this book! Even if you are not struggling with any sort of condition, you will still gain a ton from this book. I have lived near my family my whole life until I decided to move to Spain 1.5 years ago. One of my biggest hesitations before moving was what if I get sick again and I am far from my family?? These shouldn’t have to be the types of thoughts that occupy my brain before an exciting move. The security from the information I learned in this book was priceless and aided in a more peaceful move. I will warn you, he does talk about spirits, angels, and whatnot….I understand this can be uncomfortable for some because it questions our current known reality but all I ask is for you to GIVE IN. Give in, let go and absorb all the benefits :)

2. Becoming Supernatural: How Common People Are Doing the Uncommon by Dr. Joe Dispenza

This is a book that completely changed the way I look at my thoughts. It solidifies just how STRONG the mind-body connection is. I mean I knew it was definitely real but I didn’t know how mind-blowing and powerful it could be. I like this book because it is backed by a ton of science. It is understandable that you are skeptical about topics we don’t necessarily learn about in school and whatnot. If you are more science-driven, this is the book for you!

The author is a doctor who was hit by a car and told he may be paralyzed forever if he didn’t go through invasive surgery. Against all the doctors’ best wishes, he chose not to go through with the surgery and instead went home and healed himself with his mind alone in just a few months. He used powerful visualization techniques that lead to his recovery. 

This book will tell you exactly how you can tap into your own power that exists in ALL of us. Yes all of us! You don’t need to be a guru or master of any sort to apply his techniques. Its pack full of real-life case studies as well.

You’ll find different meditations and practices that you can implement. For example, I made a mind movie (something you will learn about in his book) that I now watch first thing in the morning and last thing at night to help me manifest my future! It is basically like a movie version of a vision board that is paired with a song in your life that brings you feelings of joy and gratitude. This has been a really grounding technique that has become apart of my daily gratitude practice. 

Through elevated emotions and a clear vision of what you want in your future (the more specific the better!), you actually have the power to attract those experiences to you. Basically your body and brain and tricked into thinking that it has already happened. I know this sounds crazy but trust me there is wayyyyyy more science behind it.

I no longer mindlessly walk through life and allow just any old thought to float on in. 

This will bring your mindfulness and consciousness to a whole other level that I can’t begin to do justice with my words...so you should read his!

3. The Wim Hof Method by Wim Hof 

If you've never heard of Wim Hof aka The Iceman, allow me to introduce you to him. He is known for his tolerance to extreme temperatures. He holds world records for swimming under ice and long contact exposure to ice. He walks barefoot in the snow and climbs mountains in nothing but shorts.

His success is attributed to the method that he has developed throughout the years. There are three pillars: [his breathing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ), cold showers/cold exposure, and commitment/mindset. 

He has been scientifically studied at length. One of his more famous studies includes him being injected with E.Coli and only using his mind and breathing techniques to stop any symptoms from arising, while every single other test subject developed symptoms. 

I highly recommend doing a quick search on Youtube so you can see what he is all about. 

He preaches that everything we ever need in life is within us. This book just further strengthens the relationship between mind and body. 

I actually started doing his breathing technique and cold exposure every day for a month and a half before I read his book. Here is my experience doing his breathing everyday.

His breathing technique truly changed me by creating discipline and showing me how much more capable I am than I originally thought. I surprised myself in how long I could hold my breath and I have even worked up to 2-minute ice baths. 

Don't worry, there is also a lot of science in the book to back him up. I liked doing his exercises before reading the book but not after I have a powerful and intentional  ‘why’ behind my actions. Reading the science behind it allowed me to fully give in and visualize my changing body with each breath. 

I would start to dread turning my shower to cold at the end but now that I know the science behind the amazing immune benefits, I'm excited to do so. 

He even claims that implementing just a little bit of his method is enough to start changing your body chemistry. So this means, there is a little bit for everyone inside. 

I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that these three books are life-changing or at least changed my life. It is usually very hard for me to say that after reading books. Even if you just start with one, I feel like that's enough to spark new thoughts, ideas, and questions within yourself.

These books not only help mental health but also your physical body...and after all we know that everything is connected, don’t we. 

As always, keep an open mind and think beyond your current reality. The results can be life-changing :)
