Hey there folks! If you clicked on this article...I understand and I feel you. I was born with a Urinary Tract Infection or UTI and had a 103-degree fever as a newborn baby because of it. 

I used to just accept the fact that I was “prone” to UTIs, go to the doctor, take my antibiotics and not think twice. 

I want to preface this by saying I am not a doctor and do not claim that I am. This is just what has been working for me so do your own research too. This is information I have learned from [The Medical Medium, Anthony William](https://thehumanitybooks.com/blog/2021-02-16-top-3-influential-books/). I am not claiming this is an end all be all fix. I am simply just sharing my experience :)

Once I have started incorporating my maintenance supplements, I have not had a UTI since. 

After doing research on how bad consistent antibiotics are for your body, I decided that I needed another option.

Continued use of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance from the bacteria, not to mention some antibiotics contain eggs and petroleum which can feed what you are trying to get rid of in the long run. 

UTIs are caused by a chronic strep infection. It can reside dormant in your bladder, kidneys, ureters, or urethra until a trigger comes along. 

I have found that my body is so connected that once I have a UTI, sometimes the strep will travel through my body and I will get a stye in my eye shortly after. It's all connected!!!!! This article is UTI-focused but you can use a lot of this information for other underlying connected issues.

I will break this article up into 4 sections: what I do when I have a mild UTI, what supplements I take for maintenance, what foods I avoid when I have a UTI, and what foods I eat extra of when I have a UTI. 

Of course if you have a serious UTI...see a doctor!! Sometimes antibiotics are necessary depending on the severity of your UTI. If it goes untreated long enough it can spread to your kidneys. 

**What I do when I have a mild UTI:**

This regime works WONDERS for me. As soon As I feel a UTI coming on, I will take this supplement: [U.T. Vibrance, Crisis Intervention Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Vibrant-Health-Intervention-D-Mannose-Vegetarian/dp/B00SK66UJG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2PLHDR30P868D&dchild=1&keywords=uti+crisis+intervention&qid=1613911427&sprefix=UTI+crisis+%2Caps%2C410&sr=8-3), religiously until I finish the recommended portions. This, plus 16-32 ounces of straight celery juice in the morning on an empty stomach does the trick perfectly for me!

Celery juice contains sodium cluster salts that attach themselves to the strep bacteria and eliminate them through the urine. It is important that you do not mix the celery juice with anything for optimum results. It is also best not to eat or drink anything for 20 minutes before or after. 

Recap:

* [U.T. Vibrance, Crisis Intervention Formula Supplement](<[U.T. Vibrance, Crisis Intervention Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Vibrant-Health-Intervention-D-Mannose-Vegetarian/dp/B00SK66UJG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2PLHDR30P868D&dchild=1&keywords=uti+crisis+intervention&qid=1613911427&sprefix=UTI+crisis+%2Caps%2C410&sr=8-3)>)
* 16-32 Oz celery juice daily

**Supplements I take for maintenance:**

Vitamin c

Zinc Sulfate

Monolaurin

Lemon balm

[Freeze Dried Cranberry Pills](https://amzn.to/3sCCCKO)

[](https://amzn.to/3sCCCKO)If you really need extra support and money is not an issue for you, I would also include these supplements into your regime: oregano oil, cat's claw, and goldenseal.

All these supplements help eradicate strep.

**Foods to avoid:** 

When you have a UTI you should avoid eggs first and foremost. They use eggs in Petri dishes in labs to feed, grow and experiment with bacteria. The second is to avoid dairy products and if you are really committed and want to go all out, avoid corn, gluten, and canola oil. All these foods ultimately feed strep.

Recap:

Avoid…

* EGGS
* Dairy
* Corn
* Gluten
* Canola oil

**Foods to eat:**

In general, you should be eating as many fruits and vegetables as humanly possible but ESPECIALLY when you are battling a UTI. Incorporate as many of these foods into your diet as you can:

**Fruits:**

Bananas

Berries (wild blueberries if possible)

Water/meat of coconuts

**Vegetables:**

Spinach

Onion (raw if possible)

Arugula

Winter squash

Sweet potatoes

Kale

**Fresh herbs & spices:**

Oregano

Thyme

Rosemary

Sage

Cayenne pepper

**Drinks:**

Celery juice

Cucumber juice with Tumeric

Smoothie with wild blueberries, spirulina and barley grass juice powder

**Extras:**

Garlic (raw if possible)

Raw honey 

Ginger

All these foods listed above help pull strep out of the body with their antibacterial properties. 

This next tip is a personal preference, but to me, visualization is key! Every time I eat a healing food listed above or take a supplement, I close my eyes (if I am eating alone or at home haha) and physically envision the food fighting and kicking the strep out of my system. I elevate my emotions to gratitude for being fortunate enough to have access to these foods that are nourishing my body. I say thank you as if I'm already healed and then go on about my day.

Mindful eating is not easy but I urge you to try it & let me know what you think :)

Getting out of the “I am prone to UTIs” mindset is crucial. Instead of just waiting for another one to appear like a ticking time bomb, instead, know that you now have options and you are ready to tackle whatever comes your way! Wherever your thoughts go, energy flows...hope this helps!
