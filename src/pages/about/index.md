Hi guys! I'm Shayna. Welcome! I am the author of “Humanity”. For the past fews years I would say to my family, “I'm going to write a book...blah blah blah”. One day while walking to work, I decided I was tired of the laundry list of things I said I wanted to try or accomplish but never did. I decided to finally put my money where my mouth was and...well here we are. Yay!

I’ll be up front. I have zero qualifications to write a book or start a blog. I studied animal science in college and to be honest, I took like one English class during that time. My parents even enrolled me in a remedial speed reading class in high school because I could never finish my SATs in time. I just like to take my time and read every word...what can I say?

As I write this, I am currently an English teacher in Spain. Before you think, “Hey! You liar! You're an english teacher for goodness sake!”. This was never part of the plan. And a little secret: it's the easiest way to get a visa in Spain. Oops. But I am enjoying every second of it.

What I've learned is that you can plan all you want, but you seriously never know how it’ll all play out. Which brings me here. To this blog. Total imposter syndrome!

I'm telling you all of this because I want you to feel like you can come on this journey with me and feel comfortable relating to me through these words on your phone or computer screen. Here is a quick list of things that I am interested in so you know what you're getting yourself into (just to name a few):

* Travel
* Learning Spanish
* Indie music
* Vegan food and restaurants
* Manifesting/Law of Attraction
* Yoga & meditation
* The environment

So strap in (does that sound weird? buckle up? better!) as we go on this journey together. And hey, Shayna...if no one is reading this currently, who cares?! At least you are putting your money where your mouth is. ;)

And self-validation and acceptance is really the most important thing that matters at the end of the day. Amiright?? Okay, I promise I'm done now. Enjoy :)
